# GPS-Data-Logger-using-STM32
This project demonstrates real-time GPS data acquisition using an STM32F4 series microcontroller. The system is designed to receive data from a GPS module (like NEO-6M) via USART1 using DMA, and transmit the received data to a serial terminal through USART2 for debugging or logging purposes.
